Configuring the webcam
==============
The default IP address of the webcam is 192.168.0.20
with the username being **admin** and there is no password.

Configure the webcam such that access control is disabled for single image fetching. (TODO: explain better),
and increase the resolution to 640x480

configure your virtual machine such that it can access the ethernet and set a static ip address in ubuntu.
